# Final Project: End-to-End Data Engineering Platform

https://github.com/dreamswithtali/adv_dataEngineering/tree/main/project

## 1. Integrate Components
Combine components from Assignments 1, 2, and 3 to create a complete end-to-end data engineering platform.

## 2. Implement Data Retention Policies
Configure data lifecycle management in Amazon S3.

## 3. Apply Security Best Practices
Ensure the platform is secure by enabling encryption, setting up access controls, and using IAM.

## 4. Optimize Platform for Cost
Utilize cost-effective storage options and monitor resource utilization.

## 5. Conduct Thorough Testing
Ensure the platform functions correctly by testing data ingestion, processing, aggregation, and visualization.

## 6. Implement CI/CD
Automate deployment and updates using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild.

## 7. Prepare Comprehensive Documentation
Provide detailed setup instructions, usage guidelines, troubleshooting tips, and updated architecture diagrams.

## 8. Demonstrate Functionality
Showcase the platformâ€™s capabilities by ingesting a sample dataset, processing it, aggregating the results, and creating visualizations.

## 9. Prepare Project Presentation
Highlight key features, challenges encountered, and lessons learned during the implementation process.
